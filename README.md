## The application
The application works by allowing users to enter in details on the target areas they are trying to exercise. The application will use a third party API to search for possible work out routines the user can implement to address their workout goals. 
The APIs will compare the targeted areas to be exercised against a database of workout sessions and return suggestions of exercises to be performed and the various equipments for them, allowing users to quickly implement the suggested routines.
Should users be interested, details on workout trainers will also be made available to help advise on any concerns, and user inquiries
